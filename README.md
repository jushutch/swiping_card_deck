A widget for swiping through a deck of cards with gestures or buttons.

This package was inspired when I was trying to develop a Tinder-like app
that involved swiping options to the left or right. I assumed that a package
existed for such a popular functionality, but I searched the internet and could
only find bits and pieces of different implementations that were confusing,
complicated, and down right bad. This package aims to be an easy-to-use and
customizable way to implement that functionality, and will hopefully save you
a great amount of time!

## Features

The SwipingCardDeck widget offers a variety of unique features:

- Swipe through cards by dragging or using buttons to hook into the public
  swipeLeft and swipeRight functions.
- Provide custom callback functions for when the deck is empty and for each
  swiping direction, which also pass in the original Card object.
- Use custom Cards of any shape, size, or content.
- Optimized performance by rendering top two cards at a time, allowing for large
  decks with no decrease in user experience.
- A variety of exposed properties allow for a swiping experience that can be
  designed for any need.
- Great for any Tinder-like decision making application.

To create a deck of any widget, use the generic SwipingDeck class with templating!

What this package doesn't support:

- Vertical swiping

## Usage

Constructing a SwipingCardDeck with two cards and two buttons that can be used
for swiping. Callback functions print out debugging information. The parameters
minimumVelocity, rotationFactor, swipeThreshold, and swipeAnimationDuration are all optional, but are set
to the default values which work well for most use cases.

```dart
SwipingCardDeck(
    cardDeck: <Card>[
        Card(
            color: Colors.red,
            child: const SizedBox(height: 300, width: 200,)
        ),
        Card(
            color: Colors.green,
            child: const SizedBox(height: 300, width: 200,)
        ),
    ],
    onDeckEmpty: () => debugPrint("Card deck empty"),
    onLeftSwipe: (Card card) => debugPrint("Swiped left!"),
    onRightSwipe: (Card card) => debugPrint("Swiped right!"),
    swipeThreshold: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 4,
    minimumVelocity: 1000,
    cardWidth: 200,
    rotationFactor: 0.8 / 3.14,
    swipeAnimationDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
    disableDragging: false,
);
```
